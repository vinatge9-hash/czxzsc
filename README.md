# Urban Pulse Fitness - Gym Website

This project includes a complete, responsive gym website built with Tailwind CSS via CDN. It consists of three pages:

- index.html: Home page with hero, programs, testimonials, and a footer
- about.html: About the gym, mission, and team section
- contact.html: Contact form and location map placeholder

How to run:

1. Open any of the HTML files in a modern browser. No server is required.
2. The site uses Tailwind utility classes for styling. All styling is done with Tailwind classes (no external CSS files).
3. Images are represented using placeholder templates. Replace placeholders with real assets as needed using the provided placeholder syntax: https://images.pexels.com/photos/5877588/pexels-photo-5877588.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940.

Notes:
- The Gym theme uses Oswald for headings and Roboto for body text as part of the category typography guidelines.
- Color palette reflects a gym/fitness aesthetic: primary crimson, accent orange, and dark neutrals for contrast.
- All interactive elements include Tailwind-based transitions for a smooth, modern UX.

If you want to extend this site (e.g., add a Schedule or Gallery page), I can modify the existing files with a Mode 3 approach (Incremental Modifications) while preserving the current design system.
